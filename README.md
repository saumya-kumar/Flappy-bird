# Flappy Bird AI
Test the game for yourself and then watch as the program learns how to play flappy bird using a single-layer perceptron trained using the genetic algorithm.

This project was made using [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/). See the libGDX Javadocs [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/).

## How to run
Download and run [flappy_bird_ai.exe](https://github.com/BinoManjesh/flappy-bird-ai/releases/download/1/flappy_bird_ai.exe). This file consists of the compiled source code and jars in the libs folder bundled into an exe using [Launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/).

Or, after downloading this repository you can compile and run the code on your computer. run.bat contains the commands to do this. This may not work if you use jdk 9 or above.

## Controls
Click either buttons to go to the game screen, or the learn screen.

In the game screen, click the screen or press the space bar to jump.

In the learn screen, click the screen or press the space bar to pause the algorithm.
